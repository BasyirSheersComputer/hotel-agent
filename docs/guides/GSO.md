# 🟩 **PART 2 — DEMO PITCH (LIVE PRESENTATION SCRIPT)**

Used when you're doing a Zoom demo or in-person deck pitch.

---

# 🟦 **OPENING: THE BIG PROBLEM**

**“Before I show anything, let me ask a question:
How often do your call agents say ‘Hang on, let me check that’?”**

At Club Med Cherating, this is the biggest unseen cost in your call centre:

### **The Operational Knowledge Retrieval Bottleneck**

Agents waste time searching for:

* room rules
* activity schedules
* family/senior/children suitability
* Muslim-friendly offerings
* monsoon activity restrictions
* pricing updates
* seasonal variations
* accessibility info

This slows down calls, reduces guest confidence, and loses bookings.

---

# 🟦 **THE SHIFT**

**“What if your agents never had to search again?”**

What if they could answer ANY question instantly, confidently, with NO hesitation?

And every answer was:

* correct
* updated
* consistent
* pulled from your actual SOPs
* adapted for seasonal changes

That’s exactly what this system does.

---

# 🟦 **THE DEMO MOMENT**

“Let’s ask it real Cherating questions.”

You type:

* *“Is Cherating suitable for Muslim families?”*
* *“What outdoor activities are available in November?”*
* *“Is there a room for 4 adults?”*
* *“What’s the check-in and check-out time?”*
* *“What can we upsell to a family of 5?”*

System responds in under 1 second with perfect information pulled from internal content.

---

# 🟦 **THE VALUE TRANSFER**

**“This is not AI — this is instant expertise.”**

What this means for Cherating:

* Faster calls
* Higher conversions
* Happier guests
* Easier training
* Lower overhead
* Perfect consistency

You get the “best agent in the company” level of accuracy — for every agent.

---

# 🟦 **THE BUSINESS CASE**

Based on conservative calculations, Cherating stands to gain:

* **RM 1.1M – RM 5.5M per year in increased conversions**
* RM 20–50k in efficiency
* RM 12–21k in training reduction
* RM 18–36k in leakage prevention

Pricing is RM 50k/year.
ROI is measured in weeks, not months.
