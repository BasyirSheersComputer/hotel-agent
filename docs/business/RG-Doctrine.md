# 🧠 Resort Genius — Canonical Founder Doctrine
*A Becker-Style Playbook for Building, Selling, and Scaling Resort Genius*

---

## 0. What This Document Is

This document defines **how Resort Genius is built, sold, priced, positioned, and scaled**.

It is not marketing.
It is not a pitch deck.
It is an **operating doctrine**.

Any future decision must align with this document.

---

## 1. Core Belief

**We do NOT sell software.  
We sell guaranteed results.**

People do not buy AI.
They buy:
- Revenue uplift
- Fewer missed opportunities
- Operational leverage
- Reduced breakage

The software exists only to deliver the outcome.

---

## 2. The Business We Are In

Resort Genius is a:

> **Done-For-You AI Revenue & Knowledge System for Resort Call Centers**

We operate like an **agency first**, not a SaaS.

The product is invisible.
The result is the product.

---

## 3. Breakage Is the Opportunity

We only target businesses that:
- Already have money
- Are already spending on marketing & staffing
- Are losing money due to breakage

Breakage examples:
- Missed calls
- Inconsistent answers
- Slow agent response
- Knowledge gaps
- Human error
- Poor follow-ups
- Lost upsells

We do NOT create new demand.
We **capture existing lost money**.

---

## 4. ICP: Niching Up, Not Down

We never build for:
- Everyone
- SMBs with no budget
- Price-sensitive customers
- DIY users

We niche **up**.

Ideal customers:
- Resorts with real call volume
- Multi-property operators
- Operators with measurable revenue impact

The goal:
> **A hotdog stand in the desert**

No competition.
Obvious value.
Easy yes.

---

## 5. How We Start (Agency Mode)

Early-stage rules:
- 1-to-1 onboarding
- 1-to-1 setup
- 1-to-1 optimization
- Manual delivery
- White-glove service

We:
- Do everything for the customer
- Take responsibility for results
- Adjust, customize, and over-serve

We intentionally do things that **do not scale**.

---

## 6. Why We Do NOT Sell Software Early

Early reality:
- No large CS team
- Product is janky
- Edge cases everywhere
- Onboarding fragile

Selling software early causes:
- Bad experience
- Churn
- Refunds
- Reputation damage

So we do NOT sell subscriptions.
We sell outcomes.

---

## 7. Offer Structure (Non-Negotiable)

We sell:
- Annual upfront only
- No month-to-month
- No self-serve signup

Offer logic:

> “We will fully set this up for you, manage it for you, and guarantee results.  
> You pay annually upfront.  
> If you do not see results, we refund you — no time limit.”

This removes:
- Risk
- Objections
- Comparison shopping

---

## 8. Pricing Philosophy

Pricing is based on:
- Value created
- Revenue recovered
- Breakage captured

Not:
- Features
- Usage
- Tokens
- Seats

The software alone might be worth a few hundred per month.

But we bundle:
- Setup
- Knowledge engineering
- Prompt tuning
- QA
- Optimization
- Monitoring
- Accountability
- Guarantee

Therefore, we charge **agency-level pricing**, billed annually.

---

## 9. Cash-First Execution Order

Correct sequence:
1. Get cash flow
2. Niche down hard
3. Build one customer at a time
4. Deliver results manually
5. Document what works
6. Productize patterns
7. Build a small delivery team
8. Add sales after outcomes are repeatable

We never build ahead of revenue.

---

## 10. Code & Team Reality

Early stage:
- Code is secondary
- Outsource when possible
- Build only what supports delivery

Founder expectations:
- CEO does everything
- Knows basic code
- “Vibe codes” when needed
- Builds ugly but working systems

Once revenue exists:
- Hire devs
- Systemize
- Delegate

---

## 11. The Moat

Our moat is:
- Extreme specificity
- Deep hospitality understanding
- Custom workflows
- Operational insight
- Proven results

The goal:
> **Only us + the ICP**

If competitors can copy it easily, it’s not the real product.

---

## 12. When Self-Service Is Allowed

Self-service is unlocked only when:
- Revenue is $50k–$100k/month
- Results are predictable
- Onboarding is standardized
- Edge cases are known

Until then:
- No self-serve
- No cheap plans
- No mass market

Self-service is a **reward**, not a starting point.

---

## 13. Scaling Rule

> If customers come back and buy again,  
> the business can scale to the moon.

Retention > acquisition.

Everything is measured.
Delivery is monitored.
Results are tracked.

Most SaaS fails because delivery is ignored.
We never ignore delivery.

---

## 14. Why SaaS Long-Term

We chose B2B SaaS because:
- Low capital requirement
- Lifetime skillset
- Compounding advantage
- High exit multiples (5–10x)

Best businesses:
- Small
- Focused
- Profitable
- Niched

Resort Genius is built to last decades, not quarters.

---

## 15. Final Truth

Resort Genius is not:
> “An AI chatbot for resorts”

It is:
> **A breakage-capture machine for hospitality revenue**

We:
- Sell results
- Guarantee success
- Charge annually
- Deliver manually
- Automate later

This doctrine is final.
Any deviation must be deliberate and justified.
