# Resort Genius: Marketing Strategy & Brand Guidelines

> [!NOTE]
> This document is designed to be ingested by an AI agent to build a high-conversion marketing website. It contains all necessary context: Product, Market, Offer, Pain, and Design Language.

## 1. Core Identity

*   **Product Name**: Resort Genius
*   **Tagline**: Turn every agent into your best agent.
*   **One-Liner**: The AI-powered agent assist dashboard that delivers instant, accurate answers to any guest inquiry in <3 seconds.

## 2. The Market (ICP)

### Primary Audience: The Hospitality Call Center
We are targeting hotels and resorts that manage high volumes of guest inquiries. These organizations are plagued by high turnover, long training cycles, and the constant pressure of "Average Handle Time" (AHT).

### User Personas

#### 1. Sarah - The Call Center Agent (User)
*   **Reality**: Sarah is overwhelmed. She has 50+ calls a day, 10 browser tabs open, and a binder full of outdated PDFs. She dreads the "weird questions" that force her to put guests on hold.
*   **Desire**: She wants to feel competent and helpful. She wants a tool that "just knows" the answer so she can focus on being friendly.
*   **Voice**: Needs reassurance, simplicity, and speed.

#### 2. David - The Operations Manager (Buyer)
*   **Reality**: David is stressed about metrics. His team's AHT is too high, and his best agents keep quitting. He spends half his week retraining new hires who will leave in 6 months.
*   **Desire**: He wants consistency. He wants to know that every guest gets the right answer, regardless of who picks up the phone. He wants to cut training time from weeks to days.
*   **Voice**: Needs ROI, efficiency, and reliability.

## 3. The Pain (Why They Buy)

### The "Search Fatigue" Epidemic
Agents spend **40% of their time** just looking for information.
*   *It’s scattered*: Info is buried in PDFs, sticky notes, and legacy intranet sites.
*   *It’s slow*: Guests wait on hold for 8+ minutes while agents dig.
*   *It’s inaccurate*: Different agents give different answers to the same question.

### The Training Bottleneck
Hotels have complex amenities and ever-changing policies. Bringing a new agent up to speed takes weeks, and by the time they are proficient, they often leave.

## 4. The Offer (The Solution)

**Resort Genius** is not just a chatbot; it's a **Hybrid Intelligence Engine** that sits alongside the agent.

### Key Value Propositions
1.  **Instant Answers (<3s)**: No more digging. Type a question, get the answer immediately.
2.  **Hybrid Knowledge**: Combines *Internal Data* (policies, menus, hours) with *External Data* (Google Maps, local pharmacies, traffic).
3.  **Source of Truth**: Every answer comes with a citation (e.g., "Source: 2024 F&B Manual"), building total trust.
4.  **Zero-Training Onboarding**: New hires can perform like veterans on Day 1 because the knowledge is in the tool, not just in their heads.

### The "Hook"
"Stop paying your agents to search for files. Pay them to serve your guests."

## 5. Branding & Design Language

### Brand Vibe
*   **Calm**: The call center is chaotic; our tool is the eye of the storm.
*   **Efficient**: Every pixel serves a purpose. No fluff.
*   **Trustworthy**: We are the definitive source of truth.

### Design System (For the Website)

#### Color Palette
*   **Primary Action**: `Royal Blue` (#2563EB) - Used for CTAs and key interactions. Represents trust and intelligence.
*   **Secondary/Accent**: `Teal Cyan` (#06B6D4) - Used for highlights and "AI" elements. Represents speed and modernity.
*   **Backgrounds**:
    *   `Clean White` (#FFFFFF) for main content areas.
    *   `Soft Slate` (#F8FAFC) for secondary sections to reduce eye strain.
*   **Text**:
    *   `Deep Navy` (#0F172A) for headings (softer than black).
    *   `Slate Gray` (#475569) for body text.

#### Typography
*   **Headings**: **Inter** or **Plus Jakarta Sans**. Bold, tight tracking, modern.
*   **Body**: **Inter** or **Roboto**. High legibility, neutral character.
*   **Monospace**: **JetBrains Mono** or **Fira Code** (sparingly, for data snippets or search queries).

#### UI/UX Principles
1.  **"Type & Forget"**: The hero section should demonstrate the core interaction—a simple search bar that yields a rich result.
2.  **Glassmorphism**: Use subtle glass effects on cards to overlay them on map backgrounds or abstract hotel imagery, symbolizing transparency and depth.
3.  **High Contrast**: Critical information (answers, open/closed status) must pop.
4.  **Micro-Interactions**: Smooth transitions when search results appear. The interface should feel "alive" and faster than thought.

### Imagery Strategy
*   Use high-quality images of *calm, smiling agents* wearing headsets, but in clean, modern environments (not cluttered cubicles).
*   Overlay UI mockups of Resort Genius directly onto the images to show it "in action."
*   Abstract backgrounds featuring geometric shapes or map contours to hint at the "Hybrid Intelligence" (Data + Location).
